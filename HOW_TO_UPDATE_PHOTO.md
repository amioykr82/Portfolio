# üì∏ How to Add Your Professional Photo to GitHub Pages

## üéØ Professional Approach: Fixed Photo for All Visitors

Your portfolio now displays a clean, professional photo without any upload functionality.

## üìã Two Options to Update Your Photo:

### **Option 1: Upload Photo to GitHub Repository (Recommended)**

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Photo
- **Size**: 400x400 pixels minimum (square format works best)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Quality**: High-resolution, professional headshot
- **Background**: Clean, professional background

#### Step 2: Add Photo to Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/amioykr82/Portfolio`
2. Click **"Add file"** ‚Üí **"Upload files"**
3. Drag your photo file (name it: `profile-photo.jpg`)
4. Commit with message: "Add professional profile photo"

#### Step 3: Update index.html
1. Edit `index.html` in GitHub
2. Find this line (around line 489):
   ```html
   <img id="profile-photo" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/project-marc-test-public/20231224_124252.jpg-06a76197-4ac2-43db-a642-b26caf32831b" alt="Dr. Amioy Kumar">
   ```
3. Replace with:
   ```html
   <img id="profile-photo" src="./profile-photo.jpg" alt="Dr. Amioy Kumar">
   ```
4. Commit changes

#### Step 4: Automatic Deployment
- GitHub Pages will automatically update your site in 1-5 minutes
- Visit: `https://amioykr82.github.io/Portfolio` to see your new photo

### **Option 2: Use External Image URL**

#### If you have a photo hosted elsewhere:
1. Upload your photo to Google Drive, Dropbox, or image hosting service
2. Get the direct image URL
3. Edit `index.html` and replace the `src` attribute with your URL

## üîß Current Photo Status:

Your portfolio currently uses:
```
https://storage.googleapis.com/project-marc-test-public/20231224_124252.jpg-06a76197-4ac2-43db-a642-b26caf32831b
```

**This appears to be your actual photo**, so you may want to:
- Keep it as is (if it's professional and permanent)
- Or replace it with a higher quality version using Option 1
